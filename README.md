## About Me
I'm a 3rd Year Bachelor of Computer Science student deeply passionate about game development, with a keen interest in Minecraft. My journey in computer science has led me to explore both hardware and software, and I'm always on the lookout to learn more and innovate.

## What I'm Working On
- **Minecraft Plugins/Addons:** I'm actively developing new plugins and addons to enhance the Minecraft experience. If you're also into modding Minecraft, let's connect!
- **Game Development:** Using C++ and C#, I'm working on building games that are not only fun to play but also push the boundaries of what indie developers can achieve.
- **Web Development:** I'm also honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building responsive and functional websites.
